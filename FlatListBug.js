This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue arises from improper handling of key extraction, leading to inconsistent rendering and performance problems.  Specifically, if the key is not unique for each item in the dataset, the FlatList will not be able to identify and update individual items correctly, causing them to flicker, display incorrectly, or fail to update at all.  Additionally, the incorrect keys can trigger excessive re-renders across the entire list, leading to poor performance.  An example of an incorrect key might be using the index of an item, as this key can change when items are added or removed from the list.
